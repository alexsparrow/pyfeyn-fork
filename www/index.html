<h2>PyFeyn</h2>
<a href="pyfeyn-logo"><img style="margin:1em; border:0; float:right;" src="pyfeyn-logo-small" /></a>
<p>
  PyFeyn is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python-language</a> based
  system for drawing Feynman diagrams. It was inspired by the C++
  <a href="http://www.feyndiagram.com">FeynDiagram</a> system, and aims
  to provide the same functionality and quality of output as that, with
  the added benefits of a modern interpreted language, an improved interface
  and output direct to both EPS and PDF. Behind the scenes, PyFeyn uses
  the excellent <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a> system - you can use
  PyX constructs in PyFeyn diagrams if you want, too.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
There are a range of demonstrations of PyFeyn's capabilities on
the <a href="examples">examples page.
</p>


<h3>Getting PyFeyn</h3>
<p>
  Our first stable release has finally happened! The current
  PyFeyn version is <strong>0.3</strong>.
  You can get it from the
  <a href="http://www.hepforge.org/downloads/pyfeyn">HepForge
  downloads area</a> as a source tarball. You can
  also use the Python "easy install" system - see the
  <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/pyfeyn/">PyFeyn
  entry on PyPI</a>. Or you can check it out directly from
  <a href="http://svn.hepforge.org/pyfeyn/trunk">HepForge
  Subversion</a> if you fancy following the bleeding edge releases.
</p>
<p>
  Please see the <a href="install">installation guide page</a> for
  installation instructions if you're unfamiliar with installing
  Python packages. Note that PyFeyn depends on <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a>
  as its rendering back-end, so you'll need to have PyX installed
  before PyFeyn will work.
</p>


<h3>Using PyFeyn</h3>
<p>
  PyFeyn is used primarily as a Python package, i.e. a class library
  of useful object types and operations for drawing diagrams. Thanks
  to Georg von Hippel's work on our FeynML interface, we also have
  a command line program called <kbd>mkfeyndiag</kbd> which will build
  diagrams direct from <a href="/feynml">FeynML</a> XML files without
  having to write any Python at all.
</p>
<p>
  There's currently no "proper" manual, but there is automatically generated
  <a href="doc/">code documentation</a> which should hopefully be enough
  to work as a library reference. A more amenable introduction may be to
  have a look at the <a href="examples">gallery examples</a> to get a feel
  for how it works - hopefully these are fairly self-explanatory, please
  let us know by email (to professor-AT-projects.hepforge.org) if you get
  confused.
</p>
<p>
  A few things that might not be so obvious are the options, which can be
  set via command line switches: any Python script that uses PyFeyn can
  add the PyFeyn options to its option parser by using the <kbd>optparse</kbd>
  standard module and the <kbd>pyfeyn.config</kbd> module. In particular, for
  examples with lots of cut-out line crossings, such as 3D gluons, gluinos etc.,
  you may want to make use of the "draft mode" <kbd>-d</kbd> switch when
  not building the final version &mdash; this will speed things up no end.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, have fun: it was (mostly) fun to write!
