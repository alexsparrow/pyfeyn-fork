<h2>pyfeyn</h2>
<p>
  pyfeyn is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python-language</a> based
  system for drawing Feynman diagrams. It was inspired by the C++
  <a href="http://www.feyndiagram.com">FeynDiagram</a> system, and aims
  to provide the same functionality and quality of output as that, with
  the added benefits of a modern interpreted language, an improved interface
  and output direct to both EPS and PDF. pyfeyn (pronounced like "python" if
  you can's say "th"s properly...) is written as an object oriented wrapper
  on the excellent <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a> system.

<h3>Getting pyfeyn</h3>
<p>
  pyfeyn is currently in pre-release status: you can currently draw lines, 
  vertices, interaction blobs and do some semi-clever stuff with gluons 
  and specifying points that lines should arc through. Work is still needed
  to clean up the class structure, be better at joining blobs with lines
  and to implement line deformers for gluons and vector particles.
  Line arrows, labels (via PyX text objects) and scalar/gluon lines are
  currently possible but need cleaned up.

<h3>TODO</h3>
<p>
  These things should happen before a public release:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write PyX coil and sine line deformers (supporting "3D" look).</li>
  <li>Provide comprehensive vector, scalar and gluon classes.</li>
  <li>Stabilise class structure.</li>
  <li>Use PyX connectors to make deformed lines attach nicely to blobs.</li>
  <li>Write a manual!</li>
</ul>
<p>
  And these can happen afterwards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrating with <a href="/feynml">FeynML</a>.</li>
  <li>Integrating with LaTeX <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/hepnames.html">hepnames</a> packages.</li>
  <li>Get smoother hatching lines.</li>
</ul>
