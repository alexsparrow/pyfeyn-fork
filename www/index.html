<h2>PyFeyn</h2>
<a href="pyfeyn-logo"><img style="margin:1em; border:0; float:right;" src="pyfeyn-logo-small" /></a>
<p>
  PyFeyn is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python-language</a> based
  system for drawing Feynman diagrams. It was inspired by the C++
  <a href="http://www.feyndiagram.com">FeynDiagram</a> system, and aims
  to provide the same functionality and quality of output as that, with
  the added benefits of a modern interpreted language, an improved interface
  and output direct to both EPS and PDF. Behind the scenes, PyFeyn uses
  the excellent <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a> system - you can use
  PyX constructs in PyFeyn diagrams if you want, too.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
There are a range of demonstrations of PyFeyn's capabilities on
the <a href="examples">examples page.
</p>


<h3>Getting PyFeyn</h3>
<p>
  The current PyFeyn version is <strong>0.3b1</strong> &mdash; the
  final 0.3 release should happen soon. You can get it from the
  <a href="http://www.hepforge.org/downloads/pyfeyn">HepForge
  downloads area</a> either as a tarball or a Python Egg. You can
  also use the Python "easy install" system - see the
  <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/pyfeyn/">PyFeyn
  entry on PyPI</a>. Or you can check it out directly from HepForge
  Subversion if you fancy following the bleeding edge releases.
</p>
<p>
  Please see the <a href="install">installation guide page</a> for
  installation instructions if you're unfamiliar with installing
  Python packages. Note that PyFeyn depends on <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a>
  as its rendering back-end, so you'll need to have PyX installed
  before PyFeyn will work.
</p>


<h3>Using PyFeyn</h3>
<p>
  PyFeyn is almost ready for a public beta version. Thanks to Georg von Hippel
  for providing some very nice functionality when I was too busy (for months!)
  to do any work on it. You can try using the code from the Subversion
  trunk now, but we'll have a "proper" release soon.
</p>
<p>
  There's currently no "proper" manual, but there is automatically generated
  <a href="doc/">code documentation</a> which should hopefully be enough. Hopefully
  most of the examples above are fairly self-explanatory &mdash; please let us know
  by email if you get confused.
