<h2>PyFeyn installation guide</h2>
<a href="pyfeyn-logo"><img style="margin:1em; border:0; float:right;" src="pyfeyn-logo-small" /></a>
<p>
  PyFeyn is a standard Python package using the
  <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a>
  system, which for the main part behaves just like Python's normal "distutils".
  For now, installation can only be carried out using the <kbd>setup.py</kbd>
  script - we'll get the automatic <kbd>easy_install</kbd> method working soon.
</p>


<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
  PyFeyn depends on the <a href="http://pyx.sf.net">PyX</a> Python graphics
  library - you'll have to install it for PyFeyn to work. You can either install
  it using the methods described on the PyX web page, via an automatic EasyInstall
  dependency when installing PyFeyn (untested, but should work in principle),
  or via your operating system's package manager, if it knows about PyX
  &mdash; Ubuntu Linux does, for example, under the name <kbd>python-pyx</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to have LaTeX output in your Feynman graphs, then obviously
  you need to have LaTeX installed on your system. If you want to have access
  to the convenient particle name macros used in the examples, then you'll need
  to install the LaTeX <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/hepnames.html">hepnames</a>
  package. This in turn requires two other non-standard LaTeX packages,
  <kbd>hepparticles</kbd> and <kbd>maybemath</kbd>, but it's worth it!
</p>


<h3>Installing using <kbd>setup.py</kbd></h3>
<p>
  The "normal" way to install a Python package applies for PyFeyn. There are
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/inst/trivial-install.html">good instructions</a>
  in the <a href="http://docs.python.org">Python documentation</a>, otherwise
  my comparably haphazard instructions are below :-)
</p>
<p>
  So, first download and expand the source tarball, then <kbd>cd</kbd> to the
  expanded directory. Now the command that you'll run depends on whether you
  have root access on your system.
</p>
<p>
  If you do have root access and want to make a system-wide installation, run
  <kbd>python setup.py install</kbd>. This will probably install the libraries into
  your <kbd>/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/pyfeyn</kbd> directory. That
  should be all you need to do (please let us know if it isn't).
</p>
<p>
  If you don't have root privileges or for other reasons just want to make a local
  installation, then you probably want to run the <kbd>setup.py</kbd> script with
  an argument to point at a local Python library directory. The Python docs have a
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/inst/alt-install-windows.html">page which specially
  covers this situation</a> &mdash; I'm going to use the "home" scheme here.
</p>
<p>
  We're going to install PyFeyn into a directory within my home directory. I put <em>my</em>
  local Python libraries into <kbd>$HOME/local/lib/python</kbd>, and include this
  directory in the colon-delimited <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd> shell variable, by putting
  the line <kbd>export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/local/lib/python"</kbd> into my
  <kbd>.bashrc</kbd> file. This is standard Python configuration stuff &mdash; I
  hope you can work out the equivalent statement if you use a CSH-type shell.
</p>
<p>
  Now, assuming that you've made such a directory and added it to <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd>,
  you should run <kbd>setup.py</kbd> as above, but with the <kbd>--home</kbd> option:
  <kbd>./setup.py install --home $HOME/local</kbd>. PyFeyn should now install itself
  neatly into the <kbd>lib/python</kbd> directory in your chosen "home" path.
</p>


<h3>Installation with <kbd>easy_install</kbd></h3>
<p>
  As the name suggests, the EasyInstall system is a very simple way to
  install Python packages. PyFeyn now supports network installation using
  EasyInstall. To use this method, you'll first have to make sure that
  EasyInstall itself is installed on your system - you can either do this
  explicitly following the <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">official
  instructions</a> or, if you're a Linux/BSD/Fink user, via your distribution's
  packaging system.
</p>
<p>
  Once EasyInstall is installed, and you can run the <kbd>easy_install</kbd>
  executable from your command line, the choice again is whether to install
  system-wide or locally. If system-side, then you'll need to become root, and run
  <kbd>easy_install pyfeyn</kbd>. This will go to the <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/">PyPI
  package index</a>, download PyFeyn and install it in the system-wide packages
  directory.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to make a local installation in your home directory, then
  you'll need to make a directory for Python libraries, say <kbd>$HOME/local/lib/python</kbd>,
  and add it to your <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd> environment variable. Then run
  <kbd>easy_install --install-dir $HOME/local/lib/python pyfeyn</kbd> and
  everything should work nicely.
</p>


<h3>Testing the installation</h3>
<p>
  We don't yet have a proper suite of unit tests, so the best check that PyFeyn has
  installed properly is to run <kbd>python</kbd> and then type <code>import pyfeyn</code>
  at the Python prompt. If it doesn't complain, chances are it's worked: now try running
  one of the <a href="examples">test examples</a> and check that the output looks okay.
  Make sure you do the tests somewhere other than the expanded tarball, otherwise Python
  will use the local sources (in the <kbd>pyfeyn</kbd> directory) rather than the installed
  library.
