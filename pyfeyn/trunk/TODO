PyFeyn TODO
-----------

 * Allow setting of the straight components of decorated lines.

 * Allow single lines to be deviated sharply (split) round a vertex?

 * Allow the start and end phases of deformed lines to be specified.

 * Every diagram element should know its parent diagram.

 * Allow control of deformed line nominal frequencies and amplitudes.

 * Include widths and deformation amplitudes of lines in calculating the
   label displacement.

 * Add momentum and helicity arrows (via parallel deformer?).

 * Add label interface to points.

 * Make custom gluon and photon deformers with 3D option.

 * Do hatched patterns better than PyX (or fix PyX's implementation).

 * Make interface consistent and add all docstrings, __init__.py's etc.

 * Reinstate HepML functionality.

 * Add specific layer choice when making/adding objects.

 * Add SUSY particles (draw an extra fermion line through bosons). Maybe an
   isSusy(bool) method... Also, a graviton (interleaving vector boson line).
