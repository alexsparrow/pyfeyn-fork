PyFeyn TODO
-----------

 * Fix pattern stroke colour problem.

 * Provide blob-attached labels.

 * Add unattached and line-parallel arrows (useful for momenta, helicities etc.)

 * Make custom gluon deformer with a 3D option.

 * Allow control of deformed line nominal frequencies and amplitudes.

 * Provide "add one (half) cycle" method. (Full cycle for gluon)

 * Allow setting initial/final straight components of decorated lines.

 * Allow single lines to be deviated sharply (split?) round a vertex.

 * Allow the start and end phases of deformed lines to be specified?

 * Every diagram element should know its parent diagram.

 * Allow multiple diagrams in a single output image.

 * Do hatched patterns better than PyX (or fix PyX's implementation).

 * Reinstate FeynML functionality.

 * Add SUSY particles (draw an extra fermion line through bosons). Maybe an
   isSusy(bool) method... Also, a graviton (interleaving vector boson lines).
