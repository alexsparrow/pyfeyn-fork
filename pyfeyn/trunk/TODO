PyFeyn TODO
-----------

* "Visible path" between two blobs is not ideal when specifying 
  length fractions between different-sized blobs: an arrow or label
  at default pos = 0.5 won't actually be displayed centrally. Fix this.

* Add momentum and helicity arrows via parallel deformer.

* Add label interface to points.

* Make custom gluon and photon deformers with 3D option.

* Do hatched patterns better than PyX (or fix PyX's implementation).

* Make interface consistent and add all docstrings, __init__.py's etc.

* Reinstate HepML functionality.

* Improve DecoratedPoint constructor. Maybe subclass as Vertex?

* Auto-adding to the diagram? Is it possible to get orderings right?
  Probably, if drawn classes automatically get a numeric ID (or layer ID)
  on construction, which can be overridden if so wished.

* Add SUSY particles (draw an extra fermion line through bosons). Maybe an
  isSusy(bool) method...
