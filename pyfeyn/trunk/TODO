PyFeyn TODO
-----------

 * Fix pattern stroke colour problem

 * Add specific layer choice when making/adding objects.

 * Provide blob labels.

 * Add label interface to points and also allow arrows to be explicitly 
   added.

 * Make custom gluon deformer with a 3D option. Can use line's
   intersections with itself and then chop out alternating crossings...

 * Allow control of deformed line nominal frequencies and amplitudes.

 * Provide "add one half cycle" method.

 * Allow setting of the straight components of decorated lines.

 * Allow single lines to be deviated sharply (split?) round a vertex.

 * Allow the start and end phases of deformed lines to be specified.

 * Every diagram element should know its parent diagram.

 * Allow multiple diagrams in a single output image.

 * Add momentum and helicity arrows (via parallel deformer?).

 * Do hatched patterns better than PyX (or fix PyX's implementation).

 * Reinstate HepML functionality.

 * Add SUSY particles (draw an extra fermion line through bosons). Maybe an
   isSusy(bool) method... Also, a graviton (interleaving vector boson lines).
