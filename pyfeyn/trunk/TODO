PyFeyn TODO
-----------

 * Automatically draw marks and blobs after everything else?

 * Add multi-lines. Should be defined by number of lines and
   max-width/half-width OR number and separation. Arrows shouldn't 
   necessarily be duplicated on all lines. Auto-sizing to blobs?
   Should definitely crop to a visible path on the markers/blobs -
   should the visible path cropper be broken out as a standalone 
   internal function?

 * Fix pattern stroke colour problem.

 * Add unattached and line-parallel arrows (useful for momenta, helicities etc.)

 * Make custom gluon deformer with a 3D option.

 * Allow setting initial/final straight components of decorated lines.

 * Allow single lines to be deviated sharply (split?) round a vertex.

 * Every diagram element should know its parent diagram.

 * Allow multiple diagrams in a single output image.

 * Do hatched patterns better than PyX (or fix PyX's implementation).

 * Improve FeynML functionality.
