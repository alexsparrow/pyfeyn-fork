2009-05-13  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Fixed variable name "as" in lines.py to "ass"
	("as" is a reserved word in Python 2.6.x and 3.x).

	* Changed ElementTree import in feynml.py to use xml.etree package.

2009-01-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Corrected capitalisation of PyX installation requirement.

2008-04-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed bug in points.py, pointed out by Sue Ann Koay.

2007-12-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed docs from the tarball - cuts down package size
	enormously, can always be regenerated by developers and we'll make
	sure there's a version on the website for users.

	* Fixed bug with the curvature determination for gluino, gaugino
	and graviton lines: the max *radius* was being determined,
	i.e. minimum curvature! Also, there was no protection against the
	divergent radius for straight lines, as pointed out by Sue Ann
	Koay - thanks!

	* Added #! lines to all the examples.

2007-06-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* 0.3 release!

	* Updated docs and web page for release.

	* Fixed crosshatch pattern constants.

	* Added mkfeyndiag script.

	* Overhaul of the options system - it now works again AND can be
	integrated with command line options on executables.

2007-06-07  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added fill pattern support to FeynML I/O

2007-05-29  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added additional header tags to FeynML schema (those are not being
	parsed at the moment)

	* Added support for line-parallel arrows to FeynML I/O classes

	* Added a second FeynML test case (with blobs)

2007-05-23  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Made free and line-parallel arrows properly pointy.

	* Added blob support to FeynML module, improved FeynML styling,
	  added metadata support to FeynML output.

	* Removed redundant type definitions from FeynML schema,
	  added needed types.

2007-05-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Incremented version number to 0.3b2 - approaching 0.3 stable release.

	* Made number of curves per half loop scale with the maximum sampled
	curvature of the underlying line.

	* Added draft mode, so that rapid turnaround of diagrams with complex 3D
	constructions is possible without changing any code.

2007-05-17  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Updated FeynML schema to reflect recent changes to FeynML module.

	* Added Gluino line class.

2007-05-16  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added support for further styling (arrows, labels) to FeynML module.

	* Added leg sense (in/out, antiparticle) attribute to FeynML schema,
	and corresponding support to FeynML module.

	* Added FreeArrow and ParallelArrow classes for free-standing and
	line-parallel arrows in diagrams.

2007-05-15  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Improved FeynML writer so as to actually write to an XML file.

2007-05-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* paint.py: now colours, patterns and line thicknesses are defined here
	as upper-case constants (via import from PyX). The import * has been removed.
	The examples have been updated to match.

2007-05-02  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added code to FeynML writer to combine dangling vertices and lines
	into external legs. Works only for diagrams where all internal
	vertices have been connected properly (unlike the Drell-Yan example)

2007-05-01  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added support for free labels to FeynML module.

2007-05-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added 3D deformations to the SUSY and graviton lines. Again, they're
	time-consuming to render, but they look pretty.

	* Points are now drawn by definition after lines (well, there's a
	layer offset of 1000, which should be enough).

2007-04-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added silly example using multiple canvases and transparency.

	* Added a 3D version of the gluon line (can be time-consuming).

2007-04-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added frequency, amplitude and "extra (half) cycles" methods to
	decorated lines.

	* Now using copy when assigning a mark constant to a DecoratedPoint.

	* Cleaned up the code a bit based on output from pylint.

2007-04-24  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Repaired FeynML support broken by Andy's recent changes.

2007-04-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added graviton and SUSY lines - rather silly but hey...

2007-04-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added speculative MultiLine and test #5. Very alpha and ropey.

	* Replaced the NamedMark lookup with mark classes and module
	constants for the defaults. Might reinstate the size attr on the
	DecoratedPoint.

2007-04-03  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Added label support for blobs.
	* Further repairs to the FeynML module.

2007-03-28  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>

	* Started to repair the FeynML module
	* Fixed a bug in lines.py (never use == or != with None, use is/is not
	  instead).

2007-03-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added layer-based sorting of the object list before drawing, and
	a get/setDepth() method via the Visible interface.

	* Tidied up a bit: in particular, removed a mutual dependence bug
	between the deco and points modules.

2007-03-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added point-attached labels.

	* Added unattached label implementation and updated example 1 to
	demonstrate it.

2007-03-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moved Label to LineLabel and introduced placeholders for Label
	and PointLabel.

2007-02-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Vector and Scalar/Higgs line types.

2006-12-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added a fix to the Point.arc method to deal with the sign
	ambiguity when the end points are purely vertically separated.

2006-12-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added distutils setup.py installation script.

	* Moved various files into pyfeyn modules, examples and tests
	directories.

	* Rehacked the module import structure a bit more to get epydoc to
	treat the modules as public (as it should).

2006-12-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed feyn module and added initialisation stuff to
	__init__.py

2006-12-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Made logo.

	* Added 4x scaling to get output resolution more reasonable.

	* Removed explicit units dependencies in the coil deformer and
	label displacement code.

2006-12-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed number of curves per half-loop to get nicer gluons and
	photons.

	* Added test1 program (e+ e- -> q q~).

        * Various other interface hacks... too many changes this evening
	to remember them all!

	* Changed bend() to use a displacement which is always on the left
	of the line, as viewed from start to end.

	* Rewrote labels as the Label class, which computes its offsets
	using the normal to the curve at that point.

	* Neatened up the point, line and blob interfaces a lot with
	additions of get/set/add prefixes in lots of places.

2006-11-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Fermion and Vertex as aliases to Line and DecoratedPoint.

	* Made visible objects add themselves to the current diagram.

	* Made fd.draw() take a filename argument: PyX canvases are now
	hidden from the user.

	* Added get/set/add methods to Lines for labels and arrows, so
	that the Element.style([...]) methods don't need to be exposed to
	the user.

	* Fixed tadpole loop "visible path" interpretation: more complex
	than the usual case because the line gets split twice.

2006-10-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added command line option handling as class property of
	FeynDiagram. -D enables text-based debugging statements, -V
	enables visual debugging. Accessed via FeynDiagram.options.

	* Made it possible for Blobs to be attached to Points.

	* Added	"visible line" functionality, so that lines whose ends are
	attached to Blobs will only be deformed and drawn for the portion
	outside the blobs.

2006-09-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moved XML functionality out of classes and into an external
	module. Currently broken.

	* Improved interface of DecoratedPoint class

2006-06-29  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>, <vonhippg@uregina.ca>

	* Improved feynML Schema to look more like proposed

	* Corresponding changes to feynML code

	* Added bend method to lines (autmoatically finds an arcpoint)

2006-06-28  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>, <vonhippg@uregina.ca>

	* Fixed some divide-by-zero bugs in points.py

	* Added feynML as a W3C XML Schema

	* Added feynML reader support module

2006-06-22  Georg von Hippel <gmv22@cantab.net>, <vonhippg@uregina.ca>

        * Fixed Arrow code to work with PyX 0.9

        * Split code into submodules for convenience

	* Removed StraightLine class, moved trig. code into Point class

        * Added hepnames module

        * Added Photon line class

	* Added Support for tadpole-type loops into Line class

	* Added DecoratedPoint class

2005-09-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

        * Start of ChangeLog. Basic functionality aready exists.

	* Added Arrow class, courtest of Andre Wobst.
